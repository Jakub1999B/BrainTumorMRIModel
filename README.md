Engineering Degree Thesis - Brain Tumor Detection and Classification on MRI Images Using Deep Learning Classifier

Brain tumor is one of the most fatal diseases in the world. The development of techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and artificial intelligence helps to deal with this disorder which can be successfully cured when detected in the early stages. This project describes techniques that allow to detect and classify brain tumors on MRI images using deep learning.
